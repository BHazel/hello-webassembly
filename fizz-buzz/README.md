# Fizz Buzz

A basic implementation of Fizz Buzz which includes both exported functions for WebAssembly and a CLI executable (where supported). It demonstrates several examples of memory management.

The CLI executable takes two command-line options:

* `-c`, `--count`: The number to count up to _(Default = 30)_.
* `-v`, `--verbose`: Prints detailed results to the console _(Default = False)_.
